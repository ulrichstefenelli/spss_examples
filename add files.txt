* Story: A researcher has two files and he wants to append the second one after the first. 

* Basic Idea: The idea is to change file adding more data lines to it or adding new groups. 
* Sometimes you're getting access to data of an interesting control group which makes it easier to 
* evaluate and interprete your data.

* What to do with this example.
* 1. Open in SPSS menu file|new|syntax a new window.
* 2. Copy this example into that window.
* 3. Mark everything (SPSS menue edit|select all or press Ctrl a).
* 4. Verify that you see the syntax printed in the output (edit|options|viewer|item log and display commands in the log).
* 5. Press Ctrl r to run the syntax.

* generates the first file (here: with 5 lines with random numbers between 1 and 100).
data list free /number random1 random2.
begin data.
1 1 1
end data.
compute group=1.
loop number=1 to 5.	
	comp random1 = rv.uniform(1,100).
	comp random2 = rv.uniform(1,100).
	xsave out 'c:\temp1.sav'.
end loop.
exec.
get file 'c:\temp1.sav'.
list.

* generates the 2nd file (here: with 5 lines random with numbers between 1 and 100).
data list free /number random1 random2.
begin data.
1 1 1
end data.
compute group=2.
loop number=1 to 5.	
	comp random1 = rv.uniform(1,100).
	comp random2 = rv.uniform(1,100).
	xsave out 'c:\temp2.sav'.
end loop.
exec.
get file 'c:\temp2.sav'.
list.


add files /file 'c:\temp1.sav' /file 'c:\temp2.sav'.
list.
