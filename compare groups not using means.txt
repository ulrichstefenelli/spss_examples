
* Story: A researcher wants to compare two groups but doesn't want to use mean values.
* He says his data is neither normally distributed nor is free from outliers which 
* influence his mean values so he doesn't want to interpret then.
* But his question is whether one group has higher values (a higher data center, i.e. median).

* Basic Idea: The comparison of two groups in indicators from which the calculation of median
* values is useful is a quite classical question.

* What to do with this example.
* 1. Open in SPSS menu file|new|syntax a new window.
* 2. Copy this example into that window.
* 3. Mark everything (SPSS menue edit|select all or press Ctrl a).
* 4. Press Ctrl r to run the syntax.
