
* Story: A researcher asks whether the male-female ratio is different in his two groups. 
* It seems important to him that none of the two groups has significantly more women.

* Basic Idea: The idea is to compare two groups in a so called binary indicator. 
* If the chisquare or the Fisher-Yates test shows a p-value below 0.05 
* this indicates that the two groups are different with respect to 
* this indicator.

* What to do with this example.
* 1. Open in SPSS menu file|new|syntax a new window.
* 2. Copy this example into that window.
* 3. Mark everything (SPSS menue edit|select all or press Ctrl a).
* 4. Press Ctrl r to run the syntax.

* 5. Look at the chisquare results. The p-value is below 0.05 which indicates a significantly higher
* men ratio in the target group, so if sex of a subject is connected to other parameters you have to bear
* in mind there is a higher influence of beeing male if a subject is in the target group.
