
* Story: A researcher has entered his data into SPSS and wants to work with his data. 
* He wants to generate new data columns which contain results of calculations.

* Basic Idea: The idea is to use the compute syntax to add new columns or change existing ones.

* What to do with this example.
* 1. Open in SPSS menu file|new|syntax a new window.
* 2. Copy this example into that window.
* 3. Mark everything (SPSS menue edit|select all or press Ctrl a).
* 4. Press Ctrl r to run the syntax.

end data.

value labels group 1 'target group' 2 'control group' / sex 0 'men'  1 'women'.

*Calculate income subtracting 16% taxes.
compute income2 = income * 0.84.

*Subtract additional taxes for women only.
do if sex=1.
	compute income3 = income2 * 0.9.
end if.

*change income for employees over 50.
do if age>50.
	recode income (4800 thru hi = 4900).
end if.

*generate new column with strings.
string sexlabel (a50).
do if sex=1.
	compute sexlabel = 'women'.
else if sex=0.
	compute sexlabel = 'men'.
end if.
