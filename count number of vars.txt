
' Story: If need to know the number of variables there is a way to count them.

' Basic idea: I needed this function to write a small syntax programm that works like this (look at the *):
' save out 'c:\temp.sav /drop tmp*.
' which drops all variables beginning with tmp.

' What To Do With this example.
' 1. Open In SPSS menu file|New|script a New window.
' 2. Copy this example into that window.
' 3. Press F5 To run the script.

Sub Main
	br = Chr(10)
	With objSpssApp
		.ExecuteCommands "data list free /group sex age height weight." + br + _
		                 "begin data." + br + _
		                 "1 2 32 188 95"  + br + _
		                 "2 1 44 148 75"  + br + _
		                 "3 1 57 168 55"  + br + _
		                 "end data."  + br + _
