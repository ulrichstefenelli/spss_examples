
* Story: A researcher wants to count special occurrences of words in text patients deliver. 
* For example he wants to count symptoms dizzyness, nausea, and pain (I really worked 
* on data like this).

* Basic Idea: The identification of certain text passages in huge datasets with the index- 
* function is sometimes very easy so you can count how often events occur.

* What to do with this example.
* 1. Open in SPSS menu file|new|syntax a new window.
* 2. Copy this example into that window.
* 3. Mark everything (SPSS menue edit|select all or press Ctrl a).
* 4. Press Ctrl r to run the syntax.
