
* Story: A researcher has data with different columns, all containing dates but in different formats.
* He wants to calculate date differences to check how long his patients were 
* observed. 

* Basic Idea: Date and time calculation are often needed, you often need to know only some basic principles
* to succeed in calculating time differences. 

* What to do with this example.
* 1. Open in SPSS menu file|new|syntax a new window.
* 2. Copy this example into that window.
* 3. Mark everything (SPSS menue edit|select all or press Ctrl a).
* 4. Press Ctrl r to run the syntax.
