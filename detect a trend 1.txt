
* Story: A researcher asks his study participants to give evaluations at begin (score1) and at the end 
* of a study (score2). He uses a scale with a range of 20 units.
* Finally he wants to know if anything changed which is true (see the example below).
* He neither knows weather his data are normally distributed or if it is metric,
* so he doesn't want to rely on any assumptions

* Basic Idea: The idea of detecting within-group changes or a trend is very popular.
* A very popular test is Wilcoxon's sign rank test.

* What to do with this example.

* 3. Mark everything (SPSS menue edit|select all or press Ctrl a).
* 4. Press Ctrl r to run the syntax.
