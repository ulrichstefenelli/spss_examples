
* Story: A researcher wants to format his numbers. He thinks 2 digits after the dot are enough.

* Basic Idea: The formating of numbers isn't easy. There is a format function in SPSS. But be aware 
* this function formats only numbers for the display - if you list your data for example - but it does not
* affect the original data in the SPSS data spreadsheet.
* I know the function named RND but it rounds numbers only to integers.

* What to do with this example.
* 1. Open in SPSS menu file|new|syntax a new window.
* 2. Copy this example into that window.
* 3. Mark everything (SPSS menue edit|select all or press Ctrl a).
* 4. Press Ctrl r to run the syntax.

begin data
1.453424
1.468259

list all.

**the format function affects only the list command, but the original data are kept**.
**look into the data line of SPSSs data editor
formats mynumber (f5.2).

**alternative**.
compute new_ = number(string(mynumber,f4.2),f14).
