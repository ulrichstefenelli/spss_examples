
* Story: A researcher asks his study participants to give evaluations on three 20 point scales.
* At the end of the study he wants to count how many different score values (numbers) were registered.

* Basic Idea: The idea is to check how many numbers can be found over different columns of the 
* SPSS data editor.

* What to do with this example.
* 1. Open in SPSS menu file|new|syntax a new window.
* 2. Copy this example into that window.
* 3. Mark everything (SPSS menue edit|select all or press Ctrl a).
* 4. Press Ctrl r to run the syntax.

**1st possibility**.

**2nd possibility**
