
* Story: A researcher records events over time. In the study I analyzed these were
* occurring symptoms of a severe disease and this symptoms had to be recorded by a patient
* in a kind of disease diary. If there was an interval without event a missing was recorded (as dot).
* Different events seperated by a missing value are by definition separate events.
* But multiple events (that is with no missing value between them) have to be recorded as one single event.
* Finally all events have to be counted.

* Example: Look at this line of a single patient. Each hour he noted his sympotom severity.
* . 1 . . 2 3 4 . 5 6 . . 7 . 8 9 . . 1 2 3 . 4 . 4 . 5 .
* If there is a dot, in this hour no symptom occurred.
* If hours are recorded as '234' they have to be interpreted as single event.
* Sounds easy, doesn't it? But I got a lot of trouble until I struggeled to a solution.

* Basic Idea: The basic idea is to group records, i.e. rows, together
* using the lag-function and to count the events (mind: not rows!).
* The data you'll find below are score data.
* A missing means no event, but a score of 1 means a low symptom score. 4 means a severe event or symptom.
* The basic idea is to build up a grouping row and to count these grouped rows.

* What to do with this example.
* 1. Open in SPSS menu file|new|syntax a new window.
* 2. Copy this example into that window.
* 3. Mark everything (SPSS menue edit|select all or press Ctrl a).
* 4. Press Ctrl r to run the syntax.
