
* Story: A researcher wants to calculate a simple correlation, say between patient age 
* and complications which usually happen during difficult operations.

* Basic Idea: Correlations are basic statistics. They express predictability.
* High correlation coefficients (between 0.7 and 1.0) allow good predictions.

* What to do with this example.
* 1. Open in SPSS menu file|new|syntax a new window.
* 2. Copy this example into that window.
* 3. Mark everything (SPSS menue edit|select all or press Ctrl a).
* 4. Press Ctrl r to run the syntax.
