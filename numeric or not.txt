
* Story: A researcher has data rows containing coded answers (for example with 1 and 2),
* but some of his subjects responded in written sentences, 
* all the data were entered into a string field.
* But now he wants to analyze only the coded data.

* Basic Idea: Sometimes data are deliverd "as reported", but not always optimal for analysis. 
* In my opinion there is no other way to check if an entry in a string column is numeric nor not.
* Any better suggestion is welcomed.

* What to do with this example.
* 1. Open in SPSS menu file|new|syntax a new window.
* 2. Copy this example into that window.
* 3. Mark everything (SPSS menue edit|select all or press Ctrl a).
* 4. Press Ctrl r to run the syntax.
