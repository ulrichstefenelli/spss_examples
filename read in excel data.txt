
* Story: A researcher has entered all his data into an excel spreadsheet.
* He has column headers in the first line and he now wants to move all his data to SPSS.
* How can he manage it?.

* Basic Idea: There are many possibilities. The idea is to save the excel data as tab delimited data 
* (use menu file|save as and save as text in a folder under C:\temp\text.dat for example). 

* What to do now.
* 1. Save your data as text data using the excel menu file|save as format text.
* 2. Open in SPSS menu file|new|syntax a new window.
* 3. Copy all of this example into that window.
* 4. Note this example assumes your data is saved as text in  c:\temp\text.dat and the 
*    first line of the data contains field names, like age, gender, birthday or similar abbreviations
*    (8 characters at maximum, without blanks and special characters).
* 5. Mark everything (SPSS menue edit|select all or press Ctrl a).
* 6. Press Ctrl r to run the syntax.
* 7. Look into the output.

get translate file 'c:\temp\text.dat' /type tab /fieldnames.
list all.

* 8. Look at your data and check the beginning and the end of data.
