
* Story: A researcher wants to check a list of data columns if there are outliers.
* An example with blood pressure data is used.
* In this example blood pressure values below 50 or over 350 are considered as artifacts, i.e.
* data which have to be rechecked.

* Basic Idea: The idea is checking many columns in a loop using the vector command and setting
* outlier data to missing (i.e. impossible values due to entry errors or measurement artifacts).

* What to do with this example.
* 1. Open in SPSS menu file|new|syntax a new window.
* 2. Copy this example into that window.
* 3. Mark everything (SPSS menue edit|select all or press Ctrl a).
* 4. Press Ctrl r to run the syntax.
