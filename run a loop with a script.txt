
' Story: Sometimes a programming language like SPSS's Sax Basic provides better alternatives,
' or is at least more time saving. I know that running a simple loop is an overkill with sax basic.
' But it could be much more complicated. So in my opinion sax basic often helps.

' Basic idea: I often write programs in sax basic, and often syntax functions are needed (like save outfile
' or get file). The lines below show how to run a chisquare test repeatedly.

' What To Do With this example.
' 1. Open In SPSS menu file|New|script a New window.
' 2. Copy this example into that window.
' 3. Press F5 To run the script.
