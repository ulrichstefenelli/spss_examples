
* Story: A researcher thinks that weight in kilogramm using as risk factor for heart attacks
* not very predictive. Insteadt he wants to calculate the body mass. 
* He hopes that body mass (may be in combination with other risks like smoking and drinking habits)
* predicts the heart attack risk much better.

* Basic Idea: This transformation from weight and height is often needed in medical studies.
* Sometimes it appears to be a better predictor of risks than the weight of a subject.

* What to do with this example.
* 1. Open in SPSS menu file|new|syntax a new window.
* 2. Copy this example into that window.
* 3. Mark everything (SPSS menue edit|select all or press Ctrl a).
* 4. Press Ctrl r to run the syntax.
